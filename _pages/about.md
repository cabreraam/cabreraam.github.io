I am a Software Engineer in the [Architectures and Performance 
Group](https://www.ornl.gov/group/architectures-performance) at 
[Oak Ridge National
Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov/) and my research focus is on all things 
heterogeneous computing. 

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering 
at [Washington University in St. 
Louis](https://cse.wustl.edu/Pages/default.aspx), where I was advised by [Roger
Chamberlain](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~roger/) in the [Stream Based
Supercomputing Lab](http://sbs.wustl.edu/). My dissertation focused on
domain specific computing. Specifically, I leveraged FPGAs using high level 
synthesis as a means to architect hardware for the domain of data integration.

In general, my research interests include heterogeneous systems, hardware
accelerators, high level synthesis, high performance computing, and computer
architecture.
