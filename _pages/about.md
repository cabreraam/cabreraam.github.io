I am a Research Scientist in the [Architectures and Performance 
Group](https://www.ornl.gov/group/architectures-performance) at 
[Oak Ridge National
Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov/), and I hold a Visiting Research Scientist
appointment in the CSE department at [Washington University in St. 
Louis](https://cse.wustl.edu/Pages/default.aspx). My research focus is on all things 
heterogeneous computing. While at ORNL, I've contributed to heterogeneous
hardware solutions for 5G applications, high level synthesis performance
portability for FPGAs, tightly-integrated GPU-FPGA systems research, and the
[LLVM front-end for Fortran (Flang)](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/flang).

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering 
at Washington University in St. 
Louis, where I was advised by [Roger
Chamberlain](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~roger/) in the [Stream Based
Supercomputing Lab](http://sbs.wustl.edu/). My dissertation focused on
domain specific computing. Specifically, I leveraged FPGAs using high level 
synthesis as a means to architect hardware for the domain of data integration.

In general, my research interests include heterogeneous systems, hardware
accelerators, compilers, high level synthesis, high performance computing, and computer
architecture.
